# the Tricktionary API

## Configuration and secrets

Configuration comes from the environment, and a `.env` file in the project root
is loaded automatically; `src/config.ts` is the whole list. Secrets are not in
there — they live in Google Secret Manager and are read through `getSecret()`
in `src/services/secrets.ts`. Set `GSM_<secret-name>` in the environment, most
easily in `.env`, to override one locally; `.env.example` lists them.

## Speed event definitions and timing tracks

Speed scores refer to an event definition (`event-definitions`), which speed
editors (the `SpeedEditor` grant) manage from the admin interface. An event
definition can carry a timing track: the official audio of the event, with
cues for the start signal, athlete switches and the end signal. The web app
plays it while counting, and the cues split a relay's steps between athletes.

The audio lives in a Cloud Storage bucket, `TIMING_TRACK_BUCKET` in the
environment, that the API never reads or writes itself. It hands out V4 signed
upload URLs (`createTimingTrackUpload`) and stores the public URL of the
uploaded object on the event definition. The bucket needs:

- public reads, `allUsers` as Storage Object Viewer, so browsers can stream the audio
- a CORS rule that lets the admin app PUT to the signed URL:

```json
[{
  "origin": ["https://admin.the-tricktionary.com", "http://localhost:5173"],
  "method": ["PUT"],
  "responseHeader": ["Content-Type", "x-goog-content-length-range"],
  "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
}]
```

```sh
gcloud storage buckets update gs://tricktionary-timing-tracks --cors-file=cors.json
```

The service account the API runs as needs `roles/storage.objectAdmin` on the
bucket, and `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` on itself so it can sign
URLs without a private key.

## Search (Algolia)

Tricks are indexed once per language in `tricktionary_<lang>`, the index
settings live in `src/services/algolia.ts`.
The `tricktionary-api-algolia-api-key` secret needs write access to the indices.

`npx tsx src/migrations/algolia-reindex.ts` rebuilds every index from Firestore
