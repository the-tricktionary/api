# the Tricktionary API

## Configuration and secrets

Configuration comes from the environment, and a `.env` file in the project root
is loaded automatically; `src/config.ts` is the whole list. Secrets are not in
there — they live in Google Secret Manager and are read through `getSecret()`
in `src/services/secrets.ts`. Set `GSM_<secret-name>` in the environment, most
easily in `.env`, to override one locally; `.env.example` lists them.

## Search (Algolia)

Tricks are indexed once per language in `tricktionary_<lang>`, the index
settings live in `src/services/algolia.ts`.
The `tricktionary-api-algolia-api-key` secret needs write access to the indices.

`npx tsx src/migrations/algolia-reindex.ts` rebuilds every index from Firestore
